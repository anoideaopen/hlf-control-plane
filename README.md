```bash
make build-tools
```

Tools and their dependencies are described in the `tools` module. The installation path is `$(pwd)/bin` by default.

### Protobuf

1. protodep - protobuf dependency management
2. buf - generate and lint protobuf code

To download vendored protobuf dependencies:

```bash
bin/protodep up
```

### Code generation

Use `go generate` in the root path to generate code from `.proto` and `swagger` client for tests:

```bash
go generate
```
